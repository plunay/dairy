## Python iter() and next()

In python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocal, which consist of the methods `__iter__()` and `__next__()`.

List, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are all iterable objects. They are iterable *containers* which you can get an iterator from.

All these objects have a `iter()` method to get an iterator.

```python
mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
myit = iter(mytuple)

print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
```

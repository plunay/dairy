# 20190523

## Pandas

### split data into train and test

use `dataframe.drop()` to del rows or columns

```python
train_dataset = dataset.sample(frac=0.8,random_state=0)
test_dataset = dataset.drop(train_dataset.index)
```

## Machine learning

### Handle a regression problem

* Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a common loss function used for regression problems (different loss functions are used for classification problems).

* Similarly, evaluation metrics used for regression differ from classification. A common regression metric is Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

* When numeric input data features have values with different ranges, each feature should be scaled independently to the same range.

* If there is not much training data, one technique is to prefer a small network with few hidden layers to avoid overfitting.

* Early stopping is a useful technique to prevent overfitting.

### Common ways to prevent overfitting

* Get more training data.

* Reduce the capacity of the network.

* Add weight regularization.

* Add dropout.
